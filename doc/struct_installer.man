[para] The audience of this document is anyone wishing to build the
packages, for either themselves, or others.

[para] For a developer intending to extend or modify the packages we
additionally provide

[list_begin enum]
[enum] [term {Struct - License}].
[enum] [term {Struct - The Developer's Guide}].
[list_end]

[para]

Please read [term {Struct - How To Get The Sources}] first, if that was
not done already. Here we assume that the sources are already
available in a directory of your choice.

[para]

[section Requisites]

Before Struct can be build and used a number of requisites must be installed. These are:

[list_begin enumerated]
[enum] The scripting language Tcl.
       For details see [sectref Tcl].
[enum] The [package critcl] package (C embedding) for [syscmd Tcl].
       For details see [sectref CriTcl].
[list_end]

This list assumes that the machine where Struct is to be installed is
essentially clean. Of course, if parts of the dependencies listed
below are already installed the associated steps can be skipped. It is
still recommended to read their sections though, to validate that the
dependencies they talk about are indeed installed.

[include include/rq_critcl.inc]

[section {Build & Installation}]

To install Struct simply run

[example {
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/struct/build.tcl install
}]

where [file /path/to/tclsh8.5] is the tclsh of your Tcl installation, and
[file /path/to/struct] the location of the Struct sources on your system.

[para]

This builds all packages and then places them in a directory where the
[cmd tclsh8.5] will find them. 

[para]

On Windows you can invoke the file [file build.tcl] with a
double-click.  This will pop up a small graphical interface for
entering the destination and performing the installation. This
handling of a double-click is restricted to Windows only however.

[para]

On unix the same GUI is acessible by invoking [file build.tcl] without
any arguments.

[para]

To get help about the methods of [file build.tcl], and their complete
syntax, invoke  [file build.tcl] with argument [method help], i.e., like

[example {
    /path/to/tclsh8.5 /path/to/struct/build.tcl help
}]
